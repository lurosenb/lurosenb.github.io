### Making Max: School Bus to Sustainable Mobile Home
With my amazing partner Ellie, I have been converting a 2006 International School Bus (33 feet long) into a mobile, sustainable home for the past few years. Check out some of the awesome social media Ellie has put together [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88iA7BSMY1sMTs9KUB_lvw) and [here](), and some photos I've included here. If you're curious about any project details, from kitchen to wood stove to solar panels,Â ask me! It's fun to talk about.
