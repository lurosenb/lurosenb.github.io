I am a second year PhD candidate at NYU where I am advised by [Julia Stoyanovich](https://stoyanovich.org/) and work closely with [Christoper Musco](https://www.chrismusco.com/) and [Bill Howe (of UW)](https://faculty.washington.edu/billhowe/). I am affiliated with the [NYU Center for Responsible AI](https://airesponsibly.net/).

Broadly, my work aims to answer open questions on data privacy, algorithmic fairness and AI safety, with an eye towards improving society and doing social good. 

I was formerly a member of the [Microsoft AI rotational program](https://www.microsoftnewengland.com/maidap/), working out of the New England Research and Development lab (and remotely during COVID!). In 2019 I graduated from Brown University, where I wrote a thesis about AI and self-data collection. I also make [movies]() and write as much as I can.

I happen to own a [school bus]() that I've spent a lot of time [converting into a mobile home]() and finding a permanent home for it in rural Vermont. If you like, I'll give you some great [reasons to buy a bus](), and arguably some better [reasons not to]().
