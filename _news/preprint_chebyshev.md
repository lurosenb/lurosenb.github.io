New work that I'm very excited about, [Sharper Bounds for Chebyshev Moment Matching with Applications to Differential Privacy and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12385) with [Chris Musco](https://www.chrismusco.com/), [Cam Musco](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~cmusco/), and [Apoorv Vikram Singh](https://savs95.github.io/). Of the applications of some cool theory in this work: Chebyshev moment matching has promising applications to private synthetic data! We presented an abstract of the work at [TPDP 2024](https://tpdp.journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/2024/), and the full version is under submission.
