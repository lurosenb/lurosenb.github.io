Very happy to say that paper [Epistemic Parity: Reproducibility as an Evaluation Metric for Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.12700.pdf) was accepted into the Proceedings of VLDB 2023! This was a huge team effort, so a big thanks to everyone on the paper for over a year of hard work : )
