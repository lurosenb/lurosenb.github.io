(Belatedly, and happily) sharing that we have two forthcoming papers at [ICML 2025](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2025) (say hi in Vancouver!),
- the first, on a new (and I think well motivated) threat model for LLMs, [Fragments to Facts: Partial-Information Fragment Inference from LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13819) is with [Bin Han](https://beanham.github.io/), [Robert Wolfe](https://wolferobert3.github.io/), and [Bill Howe](https://faculty.washington.edu/billhowe/).
- and the second, which we had already released as a pre-print, [Differential Privacy Under Class Imbalance: Methods and Empirical Insights](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.05733) with [Rachel Cummings](https://rachelcummings.com/) and [Marco Avella Medina](https://sites.google.com/site/marcoavellamedina/home).
