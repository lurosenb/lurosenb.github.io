Our paper [Top-down Green-ups: Satellite Sensing and Deep Models to Predict Buffelgrass Phenology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.00740.pdf) was accepted to the [Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning @ NeurIPS 2023 Workshop](https://www.climatechange.ai/events/neurips2023)! Very fun collaboration with [Bin Han](https://beanham.github.io/) and [Bill Howe](https://faculty.washington.edu/billhowe/) from the University of Washington, and [Theresa Crimmins](https://nature.arizona.edu/theresa-crimmins) and [Erin Posthumus](https://www.nature.arizona.edu/erin-posthumus) from the [USA-NPN](https://www.usanpn.org/usa-national-phenology-network).
