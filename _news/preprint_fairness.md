[Teal Witter](https://www.rtealwitter.com/) and I just posted our preprint (under submission): [FairlyUncertain: A Comprehensive Benchmark of Uncertainty in Algorithmic Fairness](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02005). Really excited about some clever evaluation schemes for assessing fairness AND uncertainty under one umbrella benchmark!
