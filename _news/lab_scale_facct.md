Our paper [Laboratory-Scale AI: Open-Weight Models are Competitive Even in Low-Resource Settings](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.16820) was accepted to [FAccT 2024](https://facctconference.org/2024/). This work was led by the indomitable [Robert Wolfe](https://wolferobert3.github.io/); much credit to him, and happy to have been part of the team!
