Some new work ([pre-print here!](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.14368)) I'm really happy with that explores what we can under DP when generating public tabular data with LLMs, with [Shlomi Hod](https://shlomi.hod.xyz/) and [Julia Stoyanovich](https://airesponsibly.net/people/julia/). This of course assumes that [LLMs can truly be considered *public data*,](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06470) which is up for debate...
