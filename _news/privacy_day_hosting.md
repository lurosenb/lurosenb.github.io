Excited to be organizing the Spring iteration of [NYC Privacy Day](https://airesponsibly.net/privacy_day/), to be held at NYU on April 19th, 2024. 

Privacy Day is a seasonal event that unites privacy folks from NYC institutions; hosting rotates between Columbia, NYU, Google and Cornell Tech. RSVP through the website if you can make it!
